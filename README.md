## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I worked with new concepts such as background positioning and feel more comfortable with using the display of flex. Also, I enjoyed positioning the content and text with the profile card. It helped me get more comfortable with margin and padding property.

Background-position code: 

```css
main {
    background-position: right 52vw bottom 35vh, left 48vw top 52vh;
    background-position-x: right 52vw, left 48vw; 
    background-position-y: bottom 35vh, top 52vh;
}
```

### Continued development

Even though I learned a lot about positioning the background, I need to keep practicing to be more comfortable with this concept. 

### Useful resources

- [Background-position](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) - This helped me for positioning the background. I really liked how the webite explained this concept and it made it easier for me to learn and understand how to position the background properly.
